Built to support courses moving their content into WordPress

The idea is to have a theme which provides as much support as possible for a theme in the running of a course

There is a default menu (of which, every element can be turned off an on in the customizer). 

The menu options are:-

1) Info - describes the menu
2) Menu - a menu people can use as per normal WordPress
3) Filters - a more advanced search / faceted search option
4) Comments - a way to see recent comments from any page
5) Widgets - a sidebar built into the home page (but not per say a sidebar)
6) Files - a way to see files uploaded to the site, allowing quick access to any files a user has uploaded
