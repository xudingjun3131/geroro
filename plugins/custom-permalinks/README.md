# Custom Permalinks

## Description

Lay out your site the way *you* want it. Set the URL of any post, page, tag or category to anything you want.
Old permalinks will redirect properly to the new address.  Custom Permalinks gives you ultimate control
over your site structure.

Be warned: *This plugin is not a replacement for WordPress's built-in permalink system*. Check your WordPress
administration's "Permalinks" settings page first, to make sure that this doesn't already meet your needs.

This plugin is only useful for assigning custom permalinks for *individual* posts, pages, tags or categories. 
It will not apply whole permalink structures, or automatically apply a category's custom permalink to the posts 
within that category.

> If anyone wants the different Structure Tags for their Post types or use symbols in the URLs So, use the [Permalinks Customizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/permalinks-customizer/) which is a fork of this plugin and contains the enhancement of this plugin.
